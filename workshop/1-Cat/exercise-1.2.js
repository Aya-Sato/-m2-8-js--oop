// Exercise 1.2
// ------------
// Creating a Cat class - Part 2

// A) In the previous exercise, Boots' name is not part of its object.
// Update the Cat class to accept have a name parameter and a breed parameter and
// then pass Boots' name and breed as arguments when you instantiate the boots object.
// When you are done, console.log the boots object
// and confirm that you have everything in there.

// By the way, Boots is a Simaese cat...

class Cat {
    constructor(name, breed) {
        this.species = 'cat';
        this.tiredness = 0;
        this.hunger = 0;
        this.lonliness = 0;
        this.happiness = 0;
        this.name = name;
        this.breed = breed;
    }
}

let boots = new Cat('Boots', 'Siamese');

//When I console.log(boots), I can confirm that eveything is there:
Cat {species: "cat", tiredness: 0, hunger: 0, lonliness: 0, happiness: 0, …}
breed: "Siamese"
happiness: 0
hunger: 0
lonliness: 0
name: "Boots"
species: "cat"
tiredness: 0
